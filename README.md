Testing area for learning both C++ and various algorithms I can find.

I prefer to write more lines of code if it makes the algorithm more understandable (but try to keep the code *relatively* efficient).

TODO: tests for is_palindrome, get_proper_divisors, get_divisors? Separate primes into different header?
